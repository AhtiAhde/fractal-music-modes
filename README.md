# Fractal Music Modes

I created this repository because I want to find out the real solution to the problem I posted to the math stackexchange: https://math.stackexchange.com/questions/3869604/how-to-use-aug-4th-and-dim-5th-notes-when-calculating-fractal-dimensionality-of

I have made some progress with the problem and it seems like all fractal patterns can be described by unit vectors and a sequence of numbers with complex and real components. This makes sense in regards of this video https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pq9LcwC7CoY&list=PLZHQObOWTQDP5CVelJJ1bNDouqrAhVPev&index=10 check the part from 00:58:00; so basicly Koch's curve is [0, (2/6phi\*i, -2/6phi\*i), 0] and Cantor's Set is [0, i, 0] or [0, -inf\*i, 0] or something similar (not sure which would be the proper interpretation). So my intuition would say, that the pattern for music modes would be [(undertone of 4th, overtone of 4th), (undertone of 5th, overtone of 5th)].
